        <h1>I Need A Blog</h1>
        <h5>January 7, 2026</h5>
        <h5>Planning | Design | Train of Thought</h5>
        <p>
            Alright, I need a place to vent. To stash my thoughts. To scribble down what I'm thinking and mark it down somewhere. So here it is. A blog of sorts.
            I plan on making this a nice tidy robust system but for now I will use Article tags as my goto per blog post, h1's as my titles and h5 for dates and tags.
            Eventually I'll have searching for tags and all kinds of fun functionality but for now I'm typing this all out by hand so I can get stuff down.

        <h1>Glass Cannon, Get in the Trunk, and Delta Green</h1>
        <h5>January 7, 2026</h5>
        <h5>TTRPG | Glass Cannon | Delta Green | Get in the Trunk</h5>
        <p>
            So I've been listening to Get in the Trunk ever since a friend mentioned it off hand and then pointed me at the first episode. I had never heard of the game 
            system in use till then and instantly fell in love with the show and Delta Green. I quickly binged what there was of the show and then happily listened to 
            it as it came out catching up to weekly releases near when they started Impossible Landscapes. I listened to their playthrough of IL and loved every minute 
            of it. The cast had a wonderful synergy and Joe was doing a perfect job of telling the story and building an atmosphere for the players. The ending was 
            admittedly a little shakey but this is something that people who have reviewed the campaign have pointed out before. (In particular Quinn of Quinns Quest
            in his review of Delta Green and IL pointed this out and even suggested rewriting it entirely to suite your players).
        </p>
        <p>
            All of this to say: I am a fan. I have been a fan, and I will continue to be a fan... <i>But</i> this newest season that they've put out, Season 5, is some 
            of the most dissapointing content I've ever listened to from the Glass Cannon crew. It all felt off in so many different ways, from story to gameplay. Things
            just felt weird.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've been dissecting my thoughts on it with a friend as I listen to it week by week but I need a place to compile and properly discuss what problems I have with
            the show. Here is a start but I think I might spin up yet another page on this little site purely for the intent of analyzing my opinions on this seasons and 
            understanding what went so wrong with this season. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Be on the lookout for that, but for now you have this post showing that its on my mind.
