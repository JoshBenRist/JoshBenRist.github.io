    <h3>What is the Point of all This</h1>
    <p>This is an outlet. A way for me to shout into the wind and also feel mildly productive. I, like I think many people have really been struggling in the past couple years
        addiction to social media. To scroll one more reel, watch one more youtube short, to check twitter and scroll for 20 minutes and close twitter... and then find that you've 
        somehow opened twitter and started scrolling all over again. I need to escape. I need to feel like I've done something productive. I have some hobbies here and there I need
        to return to. To start up again. And I need a place I can comfortably track it.
    </p>
    <p>
        On top of that I'm in my 4th year of schooling for computer science and I, like many of my peers, am getting hit with crippling imposter syndrome. I've sat here attending
        classes and acumulating knowledge for years now. Doing my projects, studying for tests, and yet I have nothing to show for it. I haven't built anything on my own.
        For myself. Nothing to show for the work I've put in. And on top of that I have little ambition to create. So I need a driving force. Something I can just put out and 
        work on little by little. Doing whatever comes to my whim. So that is what this is. A Site full of garbage and with it a way to track stuff. Time, progress, my life.
    </p>
    <h3>This is <i>NOT</i> a Portfolio</h3>
    <p>
        One thing this is <i>not</i> is a portfolio. I feel like the word "Portfolio" carries so much baggage and weight. It feels like it should be something official, a way 
        to prove your worth but I don't want that kind of pressure. Instead this will be anything and everything that comes to my mind. I like tracking things. Books I've read
        Movies I've watched. Hikes I've gone on. I've even collect shopping lists left over at my work. I want this to be a way I can play with that data, and tie it all together.
        This is a blog, this is a spread sheet. This is anything and everything. 
    </p>
    <p>
        More than anything this is a way to track progress and work across time. To this point I want to host this on something simple like a firebase deployment or somethings
        similar and I want the github for this project to be openly linked in the Site itself so I can easily click through and track how much I've worked on it.
